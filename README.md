# Flight Delay Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of flight delay data provided by the US Department of Transportation. The dataset contains extensive information with 110 features and 1 million data points, covering details such as airline carriers, individual flights, origin and destination airports, delays, and more.

## Project Highlights

- Utilizes Python for data analysis and visualization.
- Makes use of Matplotlib and Seaborn to create intuitive graphs and insights.
- Explores various aspects of flight delays to extract valuable information.
